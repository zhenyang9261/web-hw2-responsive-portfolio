                <p class="about-me">From an early age I have always been curious and deeply interested in learning new ways to solve problems. I have a solid background in computer software programming but have taken on new challenges as well. For the past five years, I have served as an IT support professional for a property management company. Being the only person in the company with a computer background, I supported both myself and my coworkers in technical issues and taught myself skills in and beyond my scope of responsibility. I was even promoted to operations manager because of my willingness to step out of my comfort zone to help the business. </p>               
                <p class="about-me">I am a very determined and self-motivated person, and once I set a goal, I pursue it with singular focus until I achieve it. My commitment to self-improvement has inspired me to study web development at a UNC bootcamp, where I hope to broaden my horizon even further. To me there is no industry so exciting as web development right now. I see this industry growing rapidly every day and influencing and benefitting all types of businesses, and I want to pursue a career in this field to take advantage of the many versatile, exciting opportunities it offers.</p>
